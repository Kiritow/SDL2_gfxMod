# SDL2_gfx Mod

This is a modified version of SDL2_gfx designed to integrate with [SDLWrapper](https://github.com/Kiritow/SDLWrapper)

It is maintained by [Kiritow](https://github.com/kiritow) and is governed under SDL2_gfx's original license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more information.

## Changes

All `SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode` and `SDL_SetRenderDrawColor` calls are removed from SDL2_gfx library itself.
